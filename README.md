# real-goodbye
This is my last push to GitHub. I am officially leaving everything related to programming and tech behind.
I do feel a strong sense of regret as I did so much to get a Masters in tech, and sacrificed my time, effort and even took a loan to finish my Masters, but I am never good enough for tech. I don't know if I will regret this decision of mine, but this comes with a lot of self reflection and thought. I am also very disappointed with myself for giving up.
